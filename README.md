#### By _**David Cole**_

## Description

_This project has been designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery 3.5.1 and Bootstrap v3.3.7. It serves as a practice project for the Epicodus week 3 day 1 lession - Practice: JavaScript Arrays. In this program we will create a survey for the user to input 6 of their favorite things. The program will store the information into an Array called inputArray. Next we will use the .push() method and bracket notation to store the information from the first 3 indices of the first array, into a second array named moddedArray. Lastly, we will utilize the forEach() method along with anonymous callback function to append the contents of each array into our index.html file._
